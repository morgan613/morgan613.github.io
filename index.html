            <p class="story-paragraph">Through these actions and just by being you, you have made and continue to make, not just my world better but the whole world a better more loving place.</p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">So, I want to express my deep <i>deep</i> appreciation for everything you've done. For all the amazing food you've cooked, for the faith you always had in me, and for your endless support. You are and always have been what lets me find joy and keeps me safe.</p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">Everyone is lucky that you are in this world and I am so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so lucky and grateful to have you as my mom</p>
            <p class="story-paragraph"><i>Thank you so much for being the best mom I could ever hope for. I love you so freaking much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i></p>
